Scope determines where variables can be accessed in a program.

JavaScript has global scope, function scope, and block scope.

Variables declared with var have function scope.

Variables declared with let and const have block scope.

Block scope means the variable is only accessible inside the block
defined by curly braces {}.

Lexical scope means that scope is determined by where variables are
defined in the source code.
