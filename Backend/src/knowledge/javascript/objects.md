An object is a collection of key-value pairs.

Object keys are strings or symbols.

Values can be any data type, including functions.

Properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.

Example:
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
};

Objects can store methods, which are functions defined inside objects.
