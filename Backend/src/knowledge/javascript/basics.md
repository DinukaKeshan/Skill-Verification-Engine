JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used
for building interactive web applications.

JavaScript runs in the browser and on servers using environments like Node.js.

JavaScript uses dynamic typing, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.

Variables can be declared using var, let, and const.

The let keyword declares block-scoped variables.
The const keyword declares block-scoped constants that cannot be reassigned.

JavaScript supports primitive data types such as string, number, boolean,
undefined, null, symbol, and bigint.

Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned
to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
