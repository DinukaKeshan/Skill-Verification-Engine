An array is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed.

Common array methods include push, pop, shift, unshift, map, filter, and reduce.

The push method adds an element to the end of an array.

The pop method removes the last element from an array.

The map method returns a new array by applying a function to each element.

The filter method returns a new array containing elements that satisfy a condition.
