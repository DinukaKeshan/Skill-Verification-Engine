JavaScript is single-threaded but supports asynchronous operations.

Asynchronous code allows long-running tasks to execute without blocking the
main execution thread.

Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous
operation.

A Promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function.

The await keyword pauses execution of an async function until a Promise is
resolved or rejected.

Async and await provide a cleaner syntax for working with Promises.
